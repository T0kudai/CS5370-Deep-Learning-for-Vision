But to achive the SoTA performance you need to do a lot of hackery. These are list of few things, we would encourage you to try: \n","\n","- Use data augmentation wisely. Read and understand how to perform the augmentations listed below. \n","    * RandomFlips, Color Jittering\n","    * Cutout, Cutmix\n","    * Mixup\n","    * Auto-augment\n","\n","- Try to increase the image size using standard image interpolation techniques.
